Locations:
/**
 * The `Location` interface is a union of the ways to refer to a specific
 * location in a Slate document: paths, points or ranges.
 *
 * Methods will often accept a `Location` instead of requiring only a `Path`,
 * `Point` or `Range`. This eliminates the need for developers to manage
 * converting between the different interfaces in their own code base.
 */

  a) A Path: A list of indices that describe a node's exact position in the node tree. Usually this is relative to the editor, but can be relative to any node object.
  b) A Point: Combines a path with an offset that gives the distance in the node's text string
  c) A Range: A set of Points that can be located either within one Node or distributed across multiple nodes.


NodeEntry:
/**
 * `NodeEntry` objects are returned when iterating over the nodes in a Slate
 * document tree. They consist of the node and its `Path` relative to the root
 * node in the document.
 */


NodeMatch:
**
* A helper type for narrowing matched nodes with a predicate.
*/

type NodeMatch<T extends Node> =
  | ((node: Node) => node is T)
  | ((node: Node) => boolean)

A function that is passed and used to determine if the Nodes match
